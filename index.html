                    <h1>Utopia Brasil</h1>
                    <p>I was thinking about how limited our human experience is and by expanding my mind I gained access to 360 degrees of knowledge. To give you an idea, the greatest of Freemasons only reaches 33 degree. I am now able to understand languages ​​I have never heard before, I am able to speak languages ​​that have been extinct for centuries. I have reached a state of knowledge never before experienced by human beings and I cannot wait to use this knowledge for the good of my people.
                    </p>
                    <p>Mental expansion is a process that cannot be achieved simply by visiting libraries and poring over books infested with dust and dogmatic material knowledge. True knowledge, all 360 degrees, is not acquired in this way. The study of symbols and control of vices in Freemasonry is capable of bringing enlightenment at least up to the 33rd degree. Note that this alone is much more than any common man has access to. This knowledge led Freemasons to become involved in scientific advancement and the abolitionist struggle. Luís Gama, for example, a great abolitionist leader, was a Venerable Master (33rd degree) in his Masonic lodge.

                    </p>However, the knowledge I attained went far beyond the limit of the 33 degrees that Freemasonry offers its members. I attained knowledge of an entire circle, all 360 degrees of knowledge, the true science of good and evil. Now I will tell you how I achieved this.

                    <p>
                    </p>The first step, which certainly helped me climb the initial degrees with some ease, was meditation and prayer. After long sessions of these practices, I was able to distance myself from my addictions and control my desires. Nowadays, many people with enormous potential are unable to develop due to their addictions and become true slaves to their own desires, burning themselves in an eternal process of complete surrender to their will. Through this initial knowledge (7 or 8 degrees), I was able to see the world in a more precise way, which allowed me to see above me an immense ladder with all the degrees I had to climb, as well as the path that would take me to them.
                    <p>
